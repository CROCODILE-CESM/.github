# CROCODILE: Python interfaces for regional ocean modeling and data assimilation

### CROCODILE is an [NSF-funded cyberinfrastructure](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cssi-cyberinfrastructure-sustained-scientific-innovation) collaboration between the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research ([NSF NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu/)) and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ([WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu/)).

### Our goal is to build a community of practice around regional ocean modeling for studying ocean physics, the carbon cycle, and more, by creating and curating a common set of open-source tools.

We want **YOU** to be up and running a regional ocean model, with all the necessary forcing files, boundary conditions, etc., for fairly arbitrary domains and model resolutions, including data assimilation capabilities, in a matter of hours rather than weeks!

## CROCODILE combines
- The **[MOM6](https://mom6-doctest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)** ocean model
- **[DART](https://dart.ucar.edu/)** ensemble data assimilation
- **[MARBL](https://marbl.readthedocs.io/)** ocean biogeochemistry
- Coupling infrastructure from the **[Community Earth System Model (CESM)](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CESM)**
- Python infrastructure from **[regional-mom6](https://github.com/COSIMA/regional-mom6)**
